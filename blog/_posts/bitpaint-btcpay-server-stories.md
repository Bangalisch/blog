Hi, I'm Bitpaint, a French Bitcoiner from the 2017 bubble.

I repair bicycles for a living, do graffiti as a hobby and recently discovered game development, which led me to what I do now: creating VR digital content & painting Bitcoin graffiti.

I also grow strawberries.

**Your History**

* * *

**Hi Bitpaint, thank you for accepting this interview.**
**Let's start with the most classic of classic questions, how did you get in the Bitcoin space ?**

That's a question I keep asking myself.
I've been searching my e-mail and browsing history to find out how I discovered Bitcoin but can't really find out.

It was certainly due to my curiosity. I think It was in early 2017 and I was in it for the money (like most of us at the beginning!) before understanding that there is something else going on ... I learned a lot during the “bear market”.

**How did you connect your work, passions (Art, Virtual Reality) and family life with Bitcoin ?**

> "\[...\]Artists will tell you that art is about “spreading a message” which I always thought was nonsense \[...\] until I had a message to spread: **BITCOIN!**"

Well I've been painting graffitis for 10 years and everybody in the graffiti space put his name on a wall.
Again, again and again.
This is how you gain “fame”, by being everywhere, know what I mean?
So yeah I was doing this for a long time and then I realized that instead of writing my name I can write something related to Bitcoin. A lot of artists will tell you that art is about “spreading a message” which I always thought was nonsense.
At least it was, until I had a message to spread: **BITCOIN!**

When covid started, i got locked down like many others. I discovered VR while attending Bitcoin community meet-ups. I also discovered that I can create stuff with my computer, I had the pleasure to write an article called [VR for Bitcoiners](https://www.citadel21.com/vr-for-bitcoiners) in CTDL21 about all of this "reorientation".
I'm still painting but i also create Bitcoin VR worlds.

## **The BTCPay Server encounter**

* * *

**In your voyage through the Bitcoin space, when did you encounter BTCPay Server for the first time ?**

Well I was selling stuff on on my webshop with a Woocommerce plugin. I was running on Opennode, not BTCPay Server.
But then our friends at the “KYC” special unit said to Opennode:
\- You must KYC all the merchants.
No way I KYC this little online shop. At this point I really had to run the payment processor myself. So I switched to my own BTCPay Server instance hosted on Lunanode within 48hours. It was so easy to setup, amazing service by Lunanode, I recommend it to everybody.

**How do you use and/or promote BTCPay Server ?**

For now my shop is closed since covid. So I only receive tips via BTCPay Server but that's working fine. I love lightning and I'm really happy to have this setup! I promote BTCPay as much as I can to merchants but nobody in my area seems to care about it, for now... Or It's just that I'm a bad salesman !
I can't wait for “[Lightning Bank](https://twitter.com/DennisReimann/status/1318867853689454592)” to be able to setup Lightning wallets for my friends and family.

## Future thoughts

* * *

**In your opinion, as an Artist and Virtual World creator, does BTCPay Server have it's place in helping your community (Artists, content creators of all sorts) ?**

Well I think that a better Patreon-like page would be amazing!
Content creators that don't really want to sell things but rather be funded by their community that are willing to pay a few sats per month just to support the work and make it possible. I think the BTCPay Server Foundation is a nice example of this kind of funding.

I'm always sad to see “Bitcoiners” asking their community to subscribe via Patreon, so maybe BTCPay Server can make this obsolete too.

**What feature/use-case would you like to see implemented/developed in or on top of **BTCPay Server** for it to become (even more) suitable for the artistic scene ?**

I'd like to have a easier way to install BTCPay on a Raspberry Pi4 for less tech savvy users.
And I already touched on this above, but I'm really bullish on [Lightning Bank](https://twitter.com/DennisReimann/status/1318867853689454592), it's a huge feature!
