The year is 2019. BTCPay Server is a relatively new project, barely out of its infancy phase. The contributors had never even met each other in person. It's a handful of weirdos who keep pushing commits. In hindsight, it's surreal that people from three continents worked together on a piece of software every day for two years and never saw each other in real life!
We had to do something about that. The executive order was: "All contributors immediately leave coding caves, board a plane, and let‚Äôs paaaaarty with friends." ü•≥

We‚Äôve picked Riga, the capital of Latvia, and the famous bitcoin-only [Baltic Honeybadger conference](https://baltichoneybadger.com) as perfect locations for the event. With the immense help of organizers, we made it happen. You could have felt the love and energy in the air if you were there. It wasn‚Äôt the most organized event. We can now tell you that we hadn‚Äôt slept that night because we were trying to come up with presentations for the morning. We thought no one would show up. We had so many ‚Äúwhat‚Äìifs‚Äù that we just ended up panicking until the morning.

The event kicked off with our friend Vortex making a remote appearance and blessing the crowd, then Emperor Nicolas had a blue screen of death during his keynote, and our evil-scientists Kukks had a bit too much of Jack Daniels to kill the tension. Still, he killed the presentation when he announced the new API and transmuter. People started coming in, and the event was packed. We had people outside of the building listening to presentations. The funniest thing was that Nopara73, who was a ‚Äúsurprise guest,‚Äù didn‚Äôt even know he was a surprise guest and kept asking us who the surprise guest was.

Despite all the imperfections, [BTCPay Day 2019](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-day-riga-2019-recap/) was a turning point for the project. It was after that day that most of us realized we want to be fully committed to building a software that ensures an open financial future for anyone, regardless of the political, economical or social barriers. We realized we‚Äôre living and breathing BTCPay, and we want to do whatever it takes to keep doing it.

If all those moments from Riga could fit in a picture, it would be this one.

## BTCPay Day Riga 2022

Back to 2022. Things haven‚Äôt been bread and butter always, but here we are; 3 years later, BTCPay is stronger than ever. It has become a synonym for an open-source bitcoin project, an equivalence for a piece of software that the entire community loves and supports. It may sound cliche, but who knows how things could have turned out for the project if there wasn't for Riga and BTCPay Day 2019.

In 2 weeks, BTCPay Server is hitting its 5th birthday. The community, the team, and the user base have grown since the last time we had a chance to meet each other. The amount of improvements and releases is something we won‚Äôt even bother counting. It‚Äôs time to throw a party again! It‚Äôs time for a new executive order.

*"All BTCPay contributors, community members, supporters and friends of the project on September the 5th, make sure to leave your caves, board a plane, and let‚Äôs paaaaarty with friends."* ü•≥

**We‚Äôre incredibly excited to announce another BTCPay Server Day Riga 2022!**

A full day dedicated to BTCPay Server, a side event of the Baltic Honeybadger conference. We've gone above and beyond to bring as many contributors as possible to the event. For most of the team, this will be the first time they meet each other. The event aims to gather all people who care about BTCPay and have been a part of the journey.

Without the community, there would be no BTCPay, so on September 5th, 2022, in Riga, we'd love to celebrate the community! You can expect many familiar faces at the event, special guests, and people who have hugely impacted BTCPay. We'll have a few presentations, workshops, demos, and direct interaction with all of you attending. We deeply care about your needs, experiences, and use-cases. We'll try to share ideas and together brainstorm what's next for BTCPay!

Even if you haven‚Äôt been directly involved with the project, if you used it, spread the word, or onboarded a merchant, you‚Äôve helped this project evolve, and for that, we‚Äôre thankful.
