Starting today, a new major version of the BTCPay Server is finally available. Introducing v1.5.0! The most prominent new features are `dashboard`,

## New dashboard ðŸŽ¨

Dashboard visually presents most important store's data, providing you with a way to better understand how your store performs, so that you can make more informed decisions. Furthermore, help you with troubleshooting an invoice problem, but also giving you insight on pending refunds. We're building the dashboard with flexibility in mind, and the goal is allow functionality to be extended via our plugin system. We'd love to hear what do you think about the dashboard and how it works for you. Let us know if w can improve somehow.
