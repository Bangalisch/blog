# BTCPay Server Blog

[![Build](https://github.com/btcpayserver/blog/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/btcpayserver/blog/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Based on the [VuePress blog plugin](https://vuepress-plugin-blog.ulivz.com/guide/getting-started.html).

## Build the blog locally

In order to build the website locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 14 (or basically the latest LTS version).
A prerequisite for the `setup-deps.sh` script is [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

The setup is straight forward:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve locally
npm start
```

## Text Highlights

There are [three types of text highlights](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers) that can be used to display different colored boxes.

A green box displaying a friendly tip:

```md
:::tip
foo
:::
```

A yellow box with a cautious warning:

```md
:::warning
foo
:::
```

A red box with a clear danger, you can also add a title `foo` to any container:

```md
:::danger foo
bar
:::
```

## SEO improvements

We are using the [Vuepress SEO plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuepress-plugin-seo) to add relevant meta tags to the site and individual pages.

To improve the meta attributes of a specific page, you can add them as YAML frontmatter like this: (see the WooCommerce page for an example)

```text
---
description: How to integrate BTCPay Server into your WooCommerce store.
tags:
- WooCommerce
- WordPress

## Embedding YouTube videos

To add a YouTube video with a preview, you can so so by linking to it like this:

```md
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

Note that the link item need to be a preview image (either from YouTube or a custom one) to result in an embedded video.
